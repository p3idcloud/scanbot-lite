# Deployment to Lyrid Platform

This documentation contains technical documentation related to the setup and deployment of your application at Lyrid platform.

## Prerequisite

1. Lyrid account. If you don't have it yet, you can register a new account [here](https://app.lyrid.io/register/).
2. Lyrid client. The executable is readily made for [Windows](https://api.lyrid.io/client/dl/win), [Linux](https://api.lyrid.io/client/dl/linux), and [Mac](https://api.lyrid.io/client/dl/mac).
3. Lyrid default config. Follow these instructions for [adding default config](https://docs.lyrid.io/initialization#adding-default-config)

## Express.js deployment

Firstly, create a new file named `.lyrid-definition.yml` at your Express.js root directory. Here's an example of the file:

```
# path: ./.lyrid-definition.yml

name: scanbot-backend-express
description: Backend service for Scanbot project built with Express.js
ignoreFiles: .git node_modules
modules:
  - name: nodejs14-express4
    language: nodejs14.x
    web: express
    description: NodeJS v14.x module using Express web framework v4.x
    functions:
      - name: entry
        entry: entry.js
        description: the entry point for the function
```

Then, upload your code to Lyrid platform by running the following command:

```
lc code submit
```

Once it done uploading, you should be able to see the public endpoint for your application at the end of the command output:

```
âœ… App build and deployment completed: LYR
ðŸš€ Run your endpoint at: https://api.lyrid.io/x/scanbot-backend-express/nodejs14-express4/latest/entry/
ðŸš€ Try our new subdomain at: https://wnxb.lyr.id
```

After the initial upload, update your `.env` file with the Lyrid public URL, like so:

```
BASE_URL=https://wnxb.lyr.id/
FRONTEND_URL=https://s22d.lyr.id/
```

Once you did that, run the following command to update your application at Lyrid platform:

```
lc code submit
```
